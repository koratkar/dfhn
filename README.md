# DFHN
DFHN (distraction free hacker news) removes the comment links from Hacker News to make it less distracting, and more link a feed aggregator. Inspired by DFTube, which does the same for YouTube. (I also added youtube restriction).

There are ways to disable this without disabling the extension.

The popup lets you post the link from whichever page you are currently on!

To use the safari extension, just compile whatever's in the "redoctrinate" extension.
